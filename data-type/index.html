A character in computing is a binary number that represents one of these written symbols. The representation of a given binary number is determined by which symbol from a predefined set of written symbols is represented by that binary number. These sets of symbols, each associated with a binary number, are known as character sets. The standard character sets are ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and Unicode.</p><p>There are also characters, which do not represent a written symbol, called &quot;control codes&quot;. Control codes are instructions to format or process text, for example a carriage return. Spaces and tabs, known as &quot;whitespace&quot;, are also represented as characters.</p><p>Historically, the term character has also been used to denote a specific number of adjacent binary digits.</p><p>Characters are typically combined to form a sequence, which are referred to as &quot;strings&quot;.</p><p>Source(s):</p><ul><li>https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zfspfcw/revision/7</li><li>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing)</li></ul></article></div></div></div></body></html>
