The lack of specification of the development process itself means it is open to whatever the company culture works best with.</p><p>The main disadvantage is that the lack of specification of the development process by the methodology means that it is highly dependent on lead developers or programmers to guide the process. It also doesn't work as efficiently as other methodologies for smaller projects, because the benefits of the speed of product development has less effect on a smaller project, while the negatives of a less rigid development process are more pronounced compared with other methodologies. Documentation is also not prioritised, so there may be less, which could result in the software not being very maintainable (due to lack of developer documentation), and the lack of user documentation makes it unviable for software that offers complex features that would require documentation to teach the user how to use the features.</p><p>Real world software that may be built using this methodology may be products that aim to be brought to market as soon as possible before competitors, and software that isn't mission-critical (due to it's focus on quickly producing new features, rather than planning a structure of how those features should best be implemented, such that the software will have fewer bugs and be more reliable). These types of software could be for entertainment applications that aren't guided by the requirements of a highly structured workflow, such as chat, video and small games (the complexity of larger games would require a more structured development process that would produce a codebase that could be more reliably built upon, and that the structure of which would be immediately understood by other developers and development teams working on the project), also small niche applications for a specific market, where the code wouldn't be too complex, and would be designed for adding features that provide functionality for that market.</p><p>Source(s):</p><ul><li>https://www.productplan.com/glossary/feature-driven-development/</li></ul></article></div></div></div></body></html>
