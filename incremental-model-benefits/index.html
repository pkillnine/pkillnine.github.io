It also wastes less development resources on further developing components that the client realises they don't need.</p><p>The kind of software this development methodology would benefit is software that is designed for aiding a work environment which may have changing workflows, such as a business interacting with different types of products in different ways. In this example, the incremental model would allow the software to be focused on adding functionality that fits new requirements of the client in aiding the workflow of their business, and allows for feedback from the client (as to what works better at aiding the internal processes/procedures of their business) to guide the development of the software in terms of functionality.</p></article></div></div></div></body></html>
