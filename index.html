A character in computing is a binary number that represents one of these written symbols. The representation of a given binary number is determined by which symbol from a predefined set of written symbols is represented by that binary number. These sets of symbols, each associated with a binary number, are known as character sets. The standard character sets are ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) and Unicode.</p><a class="continue-reading" href="/data-type">Continue reading</a><a class="continue-reading-arrow" href="/data-type"> →</a></span><p class="post-meta">Mar 22, 2021</p></div><div class="post py3"><a href="/object-oriented-programming" class="post-link"><h2 class=" post-title">Object-Oriented Programming</h2></a><span class="post-summary"><p>Object Oriented Programming is a paradigm in which everything is treated as objects with attributes - for example, variables that describe the particular features of the 'object' - and defined ways of interacting with themselves and eachother - methods, which are functions associated with an object that function as an interface to read or change the state of the object (such as accessing and modify data fields of itself).
