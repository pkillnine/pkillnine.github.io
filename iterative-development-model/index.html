– A lack of specification can result in inefficient use of time due to a) not planning beforehand how much time to spend on which features, and b) not structuring the software itself in a way that results in a project which fits the specification, rather than an ongoing specification that the project has to adapt to, which takes time to do.
Needing to change code to fit new aspects of specification.
– Spending equal amounts of time on different features</p><p>Strengths – Capturing minimum specifications leaves specification open to adapting as new external and internal changes affect the project, such as new technologies, new features, new market conditions.
Openness to change to the specifications allows for trying new things which help the project itself adapt to those external/internal changes, such as trying a new feature for a changed market condition, and rejecting it if necessary.</p></article></div></div></div></body></html>
