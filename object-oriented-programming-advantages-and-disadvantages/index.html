The blueprint that determines the methods and the kinds of data that the object will be attributed with is called a Class.</p><h1>Advantages</h1><h2>Modularity</h2><p>In OOP, the code is divided largely into separate objects, which are components that can be created and used in many different ways in many different parts of the application. In this way the code ends up being very modular. This means it can be easily rearranged and reused.</p><h3>Flexible and adaptable</h3><p>Being able to rearrange and reuse components leads to a flexible codebase that can adapt according to the requirements of the project. Increased reusability of code means less time spent writing new code, which means it can be rapidly iterated upon.</p><h3>Abstracted complexity, clearer structure</h3><p>For larger, more complex projects, the modularity helps reduce the complexity in understanding the overall flow of the software by abstracting away parts of it into self-contained components (classes and objects). Other programming paradigms that don't abstract data and functions away into self-contained components, such as procedural programming, will quickly increase in complexity as the project grows, and would be more difficult to modify.</p><p>The reduced complexity and clearer structure makes it easier for developers to understand the codebase and thus develop the software.</p><h3>Intuitive</h3><p>The modularity of Object-Oriented Programming is more inuitive to people because it models the way people naturally abstract/perceive reality. There are far too many processes going on in the world for people to be aware of all the time, so we abstract them into objects according to how we use them: for instance, when people think of a car, typically they will think of it in terms of how they use it, as something they get in, start, and move using pedals, steering wheel, etc, in order to control it. All these aspects are abstractions of what is really happening, for example pushing the accelerator doesn't inherently make the car go forward, pushing the accelerator increases fuel flow into the engine, which causes more power to be output by the engine, which forces the back wheels to turn.</p><h3>Extensible</h3><p>Objects and classes can be easily extended with new attributes and behaviours.</p><h3>Improved maintainability</h3><p>Due to all these reasons, the code is ultimately more maintainable than with other paradigms that don't provide these advantages.</p><h1>Disadvantages</h1><h2>Steeper learning curve</h2><p>The structure of a piece of software written in the Object-Oriented paradigm is not as straightforward as other paradigms like procedural programming, where a series of computational steps are executed in a linear way. Object-oriented programming requires an understanding of how objects interact with eachother, and how they are formed with classes, which also include concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism.</p><p>For this reason, OOP is more suited for larger, more complex software where the initial time cost of understanding OOP is lower than the developmental cost of not abstracting the software into components, which would become a bigger problem as the product development progresses.</p><h2>Less linear structure could lead to more bugs</h2><p>The overall flow of the program will be more complex than with a more linear paradigm like Procedural programming. This could lead to more bugs.</p><h2>Less efficient than other paradigms</h2><p>In terms of processing instructions, there is more overhead with OOP, which means it isn't as computionally efficient as other programming paradigms that don't facilitate abstractions as much, such as procedural programming. This may make OOP less ideal for computers with scarce processing power/resources, such as for small, low power computers designed for reading sensor data in a remote location and transmitting it back to a central location.</p><p>The additional abstraction also typically means more lines of code are used to define these abstractions, which will result in a larger software than would be for a less abstracted paradigm like procedural programming.</p><p>Source(s):
