The software is structured as objects interacting with eachother.</p><p>The way these features and interactions are defined is usually organised with classes, which define a 'class' of object, which determines what available attributes (variables) and actions (methods) that an object created from it (instantiated) has.</p><p>New classes can be created from existing classes, in which these defined attributes and actions are inherited from the existing class, and attributes/actions can be added/changed/removed to model the new class of object more specifically/accurately, while reusing concepts defined in the inherited class. Reusing attributes/actions in this way not only reduces repeated code, but keeps the code more organised, and depending on the type of software, objects will remain 'compatible' with eachother, i.e. they can interact with eachother using methods.</p><p>Examples of conceptual classes:</p><p>Class: Utensil
Object (Instance of 'Utensil' class): Spoon
Attributes/characteristics: Material, weight, shape, colour</p><p>Class: Hand
Object (Instance of 'Hand' class): Left/right hand
Interface: Shoulder</p><p>Todo: investigate classes themselves being objects
