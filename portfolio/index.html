I learnt about different software development methodologies (how teams are organised to produce software), as well as the thinking processes behind producing software, such as logic concepts like syllogisms, and problem-solving strategies.</p><p>Throughout the course we produced a blog that recorded what we learnt, and there was a final assignment in which we would create a plan for a software project and present this. Unfortunately I didn't complete the blog or the final assignment due to health issues, however I did create some of the blog which can be seen at https://miles-harvey.tiiny.site.</p><h1>Contributions to existing open source software projects</h1><h2>Guix</h2><p>Guix is a source-based package manager and a linux distribution, providing non-destructive upgrades to software (doesn’t delete existing files), supports multiple versions of packages existing on the same system, almost completely uses a single language (Guile).</p><p>As well as the contributions shown below, I’ve also participated in the official IRC channel, providing support for other developers and users.</p><p><a href="https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/log/?qt=author&amp;q=pkill9">Code contributions</a></p><p><a href="https://issues.guix.gnu.org/search?query=author:pkill9">Participation in the mailing list</a></p><h2>Qutebrowser</h2><p>Qutebrowser is a keyboard-driven webbrowser, using the chromium rendering engine with a Qt-based frontend.</p><p>As well as the contributions shown below, I’ve also participated in the official IRC channel, providing support for other developers and users.</p><h3>Code contributions</h3><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/pull/2436">Clear notification messages when they're clicked</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/pull/2402">Add command to clear messages.</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/pull/2351">Adds a --file flag to :jseval</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/pull/2266">Add &quot;QUTE_COMMANDLINE_TEXT&quot; environment variable for userscripts.</a></li></ul><p>Various other projects I’ve made bug reports and feature suggestions for and participated in: https://github.com/search?q=author%3Apkillnine&amp;type=issues</p><h1>Software projects I’ve created</h1><h2>Guix</h2><ul><li><a href="https://gitlab.com/pkill-9/guix-packages-nonfree">Guix Channel: Non-free software</a> – This is a Guix channel (repository of package definitions) containing software that doesn’t meet the standards of the Guix project’s software license criteria for free software, such as software that doesn’t allow the source to be shared.</li><li><a href="https://gitlab.com/pkill-9/guix-packages-free">Guix channel: Free software</a> – This is a Guix channel containing software that meets the criteria for submission into the Guix project, but that I haven’t yet submitted.</li><li><a href="https://gitlab.com/pkill-9/guix-config">Guix System configurations</a> – My configuration files used to build my laptop’s Guix system.</li><li><a href="https://gitlab.com/pkill-9/guix-libfinder">Guix Libfinder</a> – A script for finding the libraries a binary looks for, and lists the packages that contain these required binaries.</li><li><a href="https://gitlab.com/pkill-9/guix-module-creator">Guix module creator</a> – A script for generating a package definition for Guix.</li></ul><h2>LÖVE2D Game Engine</h2><p>LÖVE2D is a game engine that exposes all it's functionality through Lua (however the core is written in C++).
