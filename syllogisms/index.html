The major premise contains a major term, and the minor premise contains a minor term.</p><h2>Major types of syllogism</h2><h3>Categorical</h3><p>In logic, a categorical proposition, or categorical statement, is a proposition that asserts or denies that all or some of the members of one category (the subject term) are included in another (the predicate term).</p><p>Categorical syllogisms follow an “If A is part of C, then B is part of C” logic, or “If A is in C then B is in C”. For example: Wood is flammable. The desk is made of wood. Therefore the desk is flammable.</p><p>More generally, All M = P, All S = M, therefore All S = P.</p><blockquote><p>Major Premise: Wood is flammable.</p><p>Minor Premise: My desk is made of wood.</p><p>Conclusion: My desk is flammable.</p></blockquote><p>There are two more types of categorical propositions based on quantifier:</p><ul><li>Universal propositions, which describe either &quot;all&quot; or &quot;none&quot;, for example “All A are B,” and “No A are B”</li><li>Particular propositions, which describe &quot;some&quot; or &quot;some not&quot;, for example “some A are B,” and “some A are not B”</li></ul><h3>Conditional</h3><p>Conditional syllogisms follow an &quot;If A is true, then B is also true&quot; logic. For example: If a car has fuel, then it’s engine can run. Conditional syllogisms are often referred to as hypothetical syllogisms because the arguments aren’t always valid.</p><blockquote><p>Major premise: The car has fuel</p><p>Minor premise: Fuel powers a car’s engine.</p><p>Conclusion: The car's engine can run.</p></blockquote><p>In this case, the argument may not be valid, because despite the fact that fuel powers a car's engine, and despite the fact that the car has fuel, it's engine may not run, perhaps due to a fault.</p><h3>Disjunctive</h3><p>Disjunctive syllogisms follow the logic that either is correct, and that the noncorrect one implies the other is the correct one. For example: The floor is either wood or carpet. The floor is not carpet, therefore it’s wood.</p><h2>Minor types of syllogism</h2><h3>Enthymeme</h3><p>An Enthymeme is a syllogism with one part of the argument missing (either of the premises or the conclusion).</p><h3>Syllogistic Fallacy</h3><p>A syllogistic fallacy is a syllogism that contains a false presumption. For example: All crows are black. The bird in my cage is black. Therefore, the bird in my cage is a crow.</p><h2>Uses in Programming</h2><p>The strengths of syllogisms are that they allow us to deduce information we don't know based on a premise which we do know. As long as the premise is accurate, we can deduce accurate information without already knowing that information. This is especially useful in <a href="big-thinking">big thinking</a> where we don't have all hte information necessary to work out an answer to a problem. We can use syllogisms to fill the incomplete information - for example, if I know that in a given day I will walk a certain distance, and I can predict that I take a certain number of steps when I walk a certain distance, then I can deduce the number of steps I take in a given day. Here I do not know the number of steps I take in a given day, but can deduce it based on the premise that I take a given number of steps when walking a given distance.</p><p>The problem with syllogisms however is that require an accurate premise: If the premise is inaccurate, then the conclusion will be inaccurate. Even worse than mere inaccuracy is the belief that the conclusion is accurate, because we believe the premise to be accurate. Since we are the ones that form the premise, we may be less inclined to see a problem in a premise and believe it to be true, which is why it would be important to open the premise to scrutiny, perhaps by getting feedback from others.</p><p>In programming, categorical syllogisms are very useful for rules. For example, we can deduce information about a given variable based on if it exists in a list. A syllogism rule using this logic could be:</p><blockquote><p>Major premise: Variable A is in list L.</p><p>Minor premise: All members of list L are no longer needed by the application.</p><p>Conclusion: Therefore, variable A is not needed by the application.</p></blockquote><p>In this example, we deduce that variable A is no longer needed by the application, and therefore we can garbage-collect the variable. This process could also be expressed using another syllogism:</p><blockquote><p>Major premise: Variable A is no longer needed by the application.</p><p>Minor premise: All variables that are no longer needed by the application are to be garbage-collected.</p><p>Conclusion: Therefore, variable A is to be garbage-collected.</p></blockquote><p>Sources:</p><ul><li>Wikipedia</li><li>https://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-syllogism.html</li><li>http://changingminds.org/disciplines/argument/syllogisms/conditional_syllogism.htm</li></ul></article></div></div></div></body></html>
